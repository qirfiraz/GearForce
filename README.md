For Salesforce Hackathon using Gear2 Tizen IDE


This is the repository I created  for Salesforce Hackathon in San Francisco 2014, around 11:30 A.M., on  11th 

October 2014, which is very much in the required time window.
 
 
I will keep committing code, for my Samsung Wearable device Gear2 app GearForce which uses Force.com 

Calendar API, during whole day.
 
Thanks.
